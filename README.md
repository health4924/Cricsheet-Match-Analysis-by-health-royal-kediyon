# Cricsheet-Match-Analysis-by-health-royal-kediyon
Description
Cricsheet Match Analysis is a Python-based tool that processes match data from Cricsheet's JSON files to perform statistical analysis on cricket matches. The project allows users to analyze key aspects such as "Man of the Match," running rate, and various other match statistics using data from Test and T20 matches.

This project uses libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualizations, and json to parse match data. The analysis helps in identifying insights like performance trends, player contributions, and overall team statistics.
